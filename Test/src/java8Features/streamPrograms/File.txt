o	Stream is lazy and evaluates code only when required??. 
The most interesting part to know about the intermediate operations is that they are lazy. The intermediate operations will not be invoked until the terminal operation is invoked. This is very important when we are processing larger data streams. The process only on demand principle drastically improves the performance. The laziness of the intermediate operations help to invoke these operation in one pass. Now, if you are not clear with single pass, please wait until we dive into more details about Java 8 Streams during our subsequent discussions. 
o	The elements of a stream are only visited once during the life of a stream. That is Stream instance once used cannot be reused. Like an Iterator, a new stream must be generated to revisit the same elements of the source.
